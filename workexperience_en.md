# Objective?


## example

首先，最能夠抓住面試者的目光，就是Objective，以下是一個範例：

「To leverage my years of community management experience, data analysis skills, and expertise in online marketing into a marketing consultant role for your company.」

這段履歷在一個句子裡面，用「to V」的這個句型，把三個核心的能力包裝在一個句子裡面，並且去說服面試官，要利用這三個能力勝任這份工作。

第一個能力：「My years of community management experience」；第二個能力「Data analysis skills」；第三個能力：「Expertise in online marketing」，轉換這些能力成為這份工作的適用者：「Into a marketing consultant role for your company」。

因為擁有這三個能力，所以我的工作目標適合這個職缺。

# Skill?

## example

「Achieved a growth of 10K users to 100K users in less than a year. Developed markets for a new product. Researched user bases and discovered new sources of revenue.」

這就是你的重點能力，還有在這能力之下、做了什麼事情(Achievement)，成就了什麼事。既然先前已在求職目標提到「Years of community management experiment」、有「Data analysis」的能力，在不同能力指標底下，實質上達成了什麼?做了什麼事情? 因此需要用到很多的動詞。例如以下這些字：「Achieve、Develop、Research、Discover」這些都是非常強烈的動詞。

除了剛剛提到的動詞之外，還有一些其它的參考動詞可以加到你的履歷裡，讓它更強而有力。例如，如果你是一位「計劃的統整者」，你可以使用這些動詞「Organize、Oversaw、Led」；如果你是一位「計劃創造者」，你可以使用這一些動詞像是「Created、Develop、Launch」等；如果你從事的是統整類型的工作，可以使用以下這些動詞「Reorganized、Redesign、Replaced」等。

最後、如果想要說「達到了什麼？」、「成就了什麼？」可以使用「Achieve、succeeded」這類的動詞。

接下來是Education、Experience and Reference，通常這裡不會做太多的闡述，只需要簡單的列出。例如就讀哪間大學?哪幾年在這家公司就職?簡單的列表出這些東西，如果面試官對於當中某一項有興趣的話，會在面試中再進一步詢問。

再來必須針對不同的工作來客製化履歷，如前所說、最重要的兩個部分是Objective 跟Skills，針對不同的職缺會有不同的Objective，針對不同的目標，則會需要不同的Skills，所以針對不同工作職缺，應該要客製化履歷，這樣面試官一看到履歷、眼睛就會為之一亮，覺得這就是他想要找的人才。
